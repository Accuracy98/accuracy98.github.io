## Hi🙋‍♂️，
I’m Chris, a second-year PhD student in Computer Science working on LLMs, NLP, multimodal representation learning, and contrastive learning. My username reflects my goal of building systems with stronger accuracy and reliability—“98” is both my birth year and a reminder to keep pushing toward high precision, even if perfection is asymptotic.

I’m currently seeking research internships and full-time roles in LLM/NLP/multimodal areas.
